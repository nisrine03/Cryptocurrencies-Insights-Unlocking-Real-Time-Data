The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, making real-time data essential for effective analysis and decision-making. 
This project implements a complete pipeline to analyze and visualize cryptocurrency market data using cutting-edge tools and technologies:

Real-Time Data Collection and Streaming: Cryptocurrency market data is collected in real-time via the Binance API and streamed through Apache Kafka.
Data Processing and Transformation: Apache Spark acts as the consumer for Kafka, transforming and preparing the data for analysis.
Interactive Dashboard: A real-time dashboard built with Dash displays key metrics and technical indicators, such as RSI (Relative Strength Index), Bollinger Bands, and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end solution for real-time cryptocurrency analytics, providing actionable insights and visualization to help users navigate the market's volatility.
